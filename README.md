Victoria University (VU) is in the process of digitalizing its University Transport Management System (UTMS) to streamline the scheduling 
and management of transport services for students and staff. The proposed system is intended to manage data related to Drivers, Vehicles, 
and Routes, and to support multiple categories of users including Students, Lecturers, and Transport Officers.
As a student doing Object Oriented Programming Student, you have been tasked with designing and implementing a Java-based 
prototype for this system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Your implementation must demonstrate a clear 
understanding of core OOP concepts in both structure and functionality.

Required
a) Design and implement your system in such a way that it clearly demonstrates the following OOP principles. For each principle, explain its role in the UTMS.
(i) Use abstract classes or interfaces to define general templates for users or transport services, hiding implementation details and exposing only relevant 
operations.
(ii) Ensure that all critical data such as, user credentials, driver license information,
vehicle details is kept private within classes, and accessed or modified only through
getter and setter methods.
(iii) Create a general base class User with common attributes and methods. Derive
specialized subclasses such as Student, Lecturer, and TransportOfficer that inherit
from User.
(iv) Demonstrate runtime polymorphism by overriding methods in subclasses.
(v) Define and implement interfaces to represent common behaviors related to vehicles
(such as Serviceable, Trackable, or Schedulable), and show how different vehicle
types (such as, Bus, Van) implement them.
(vi) Implement and override a method such as requestTransport() across different
user subclasses (Student, Lecturer, etc.) to reflect customized behaviors.
(vii) Implement a method such as assignDriver() that is overloaded based on different
parameter sets (such as, by VehicleType, or by ShiftTime). 

Submission Guidelines:

Your submission should include the following;-
(i) Java source code files (.java) for all classes and interfaces (GitHub)
(ii) Screenshots of outputs demonstrating overridden and overloaded methods in action
(iii)A brief documentation (1â€“2 pages) explaining your design choices and how each OOP concept was implemented
